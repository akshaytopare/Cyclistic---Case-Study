### Business Task
#### Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.

### Ask 
#### Three questions will guide the future marketing program: 
##### 1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently? 
##### 2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships? 
##### 3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?



#### Install required packages
#### tidyverse for data import and wrangling
#### lubridate for date functions
#### ggplot for visualization


```{r}
library(tidyverse)  #helps wrangle data
library(lubridate)  #helps wrangle date attributes
library(ggplot2)  #helps visualize data

```

```{r}
getwd() #displays your working directory

```
### STEP 1: COLLECT DATA

#### Upload Divvy datasets (csv files) here

```{r}
q2_2019 <- read_csv("Divvy_Trips_2019_Q2.csv")
q3_2019 <- read_csv("Divvy_Trips_2019_Q3.csv")
q4_2019 <- read_csv("Divvy_Trips_2019_Q4.csv")
q1_2020 <- read_csv("Divvy_Trips_2020_Q1.csv")
```
### STEP 2: WRANGLE DATA AND COMBINE INTO A SINGLE FILE

#### Compare column names each of the files
#### While the names don't have to be in the same order, they DO need to match perfectly before we can use a command to join them into one file


```{r}
colnames(q2_2019)
colnames(q3_2019)
colnames(q4_2019)
colnames(q1_2020)
```
#### Rename columns  to make them consisent with q1_2020 (as this will be the supposed going-forward table design for Divvy)

```{r}
(q4_2019 <- rename(q4_2019
                   ,ride_id = trip_id
                   ,rideable_type = bikeid 
                   ,started_at = start_time  
                   ,ended_at = end_time  
                   ,start_station_name = from_station_name 
                   ,start_station_id = from_station_id 
                   ,end_station_name = to_station_name 
                   ,end_station_id = to_station_id 
                   ,member_casual = usertype))
```

```{r}
(q3_2019 <- rename(q3_2019
                   ,ride_id = trip_id
                   ,rideable_type = bikeid 
                   ,started_at = start_time  
                   ,ended_at = end_time  
                   ,start_station_name = from_station_name 
                   ,start_station_id = from_station_id 
                   ,end_station_name = to_station_name 
                   ,end_station_id = to_station_id 
                   ,member_casual = usertype))

```

```{r}
(q2_2019 <- rename(q2_2019
                   ,ride_id = "01 - Rental Details Rental ID"
                   ,rideable_type = "01 - Rental Details Bike ID" 
                   ,started_at = "01 - Rental Details Local Start Time"  
                   ,ended_at = "01 - Rental Details Local End Time"  
                   ,start_station_name = "03 - Rental Start Station Name" 
                   ,start_station_id = "03 - Rental Start Station ID"
                   ,end_station_name = "02 - Rental End Station Name" 
                   ,end_station_id = "02 - Rental End Station ID"
                   ,member_casual = "User Type"))

```
#### Inspect the dataframes and look for incongruencies

```{r}
str(q1_2020)
str(q4_2019)
str(q3_2019)
str(q2_2019)

```
#### Convert ride_id and rideable_type to character so that they can stack correctly

```{r}
q4_2019 <- mutate(q4_2019,ride_id = as.character(ride_id)
                  ,rideable_type = as.character(rideable_type))
q3_2019 <- mutate(q3_2019,ride_id = as.character(ride_id)
                  ,rideable_type = as.character(rideable_type))
q2_2019 <- mutate(q2_2019,ride_id = as.character(ride_id)
                  ,rideable_type = as.character(rideable_type))
```

#### Stack individual quarter's data frames into one big data frame

```{r}
all_trips <- bind_rows(q2_2019,q3_2019,q4_2019,q1_2020)

```

#### Remove lat, long, birthyear, and gender fields as this data was dropped beginning in 2020

```{r}
all_trips <- all_trips %>%
  select(-c(start_lat, start_lng, end_lat, end_lng, birthyear, gender, "01 - Rental Details Duration In Seconds Uncapped", "05 - Member Details Member Birthday Year", "Member Gender", "tripduration"))
```

### STEP 3: CLEAN UP AND ADD DATA TO PREPARE FOR ANALYSIS

#### Inspect the new table that has been created

```{r}
colnames(all_trips)  #List of column names
nrow(all_trips)  #How many rows are in data frame?
dim(all_trips)  #Dimensions of the data frame?
head(all_trips)  #See the first 6 rows of data frame.  Also tail(all_trips)
str(all_trips)  #See list of columns and data types (numeric, character, etc)
summary(all_trips)  #Statistical summary of data. Mainly for numerics

```

#### There are a few problems we will need to fix:
##### (1) In the "member_casual" column, there are two names for members ("member" and "Subscriber") and two names for casual riders ("Customer" and "casual"). We will need to consolidate that from four to two labels.
##### In the "member_casual" column, replace "Subscriber" with "member" and "Customer" with "casual"
##### Before 2020, Divvy used different labels for these two types of riders ... we will want to make our dataframe consistent with their current nomenclature

#### Begin by seeing how many observations fall under each usertype

```{r}
table(all_trips$member_casual)
```

```{r}
all_trips <- all_trips %>% 
  mutate(member_casual = recode(member_casual
                                ,"Subscriber"="member"
                                ,"Customer"="casual"))
```

#### Check to make sure the proper number of observations were reassigned

```{r}
table(all_trips$member_casual)
```

##### (2) The data can only be aggregated at the ride-level, which is too granular. We will want to add some additional columns of data -- such as day, month, year -- that provide additional opportunities to aggregate the data.
##### Add columns that list the date, month, day, and year of each ride
##### This will allow us to aggregate ride data for each month, day, or year ... before completing these operations we could only aggregate at the ride level


```{r}
all_trips$date <- as.Date(all_trips$started_at) #The default format is yyyy-mm-dd
all_trips$month <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date),"%m")
all_trips$day <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date),"%d")
all_trips$year <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date),"%Y")
all_trips$day_of_week <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date),"%A")
```

#### Add a "ride_length" calculation to all_trips (in seconds)

```{r}
all_trips$ride_length <- difftime(all_trips$ended_at,all_trips$started_at)
```

#### Inspect the structure of the columns

```{r}
str(all_trips)
```

#### Convert "ride_length" from Factor to numeric so we can run calculations on the data

```{r}
is.factor(all_trips$ride_length)
```

```{r}
all_trips$ride_length <- as.numeric(as.character(all_trips$ride_length))
is.numeric(all_trips$ride_length)

```

#### Remove "bad" data
#### The dataframe includes a few hundred entries when bikes were taken out of docks and checked for quality by Divvy or ride_length was negative
#### We will create a new version of the dataframe (v2) since data is being removed


```{r}
all_trips_v2 <- all_trips[!(all_trips$start_station_name == "HQ QR" | all_trips$ride_length<0),]
```

### STEP 4: CONDUCT DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS

#### Descriptive analysis on ride_length (all figures in seconds)

```{r}
mean(all_trips_v2$ride_length) # straight average (total ride length / rides)
median(all_trips_v2$ride_length) # midpoint number in the ascending array of ride lengths
max(all_trips_v2$ride_length) # longest ride
min(all_trips_v2$ride_length) # shortest ride
```

#### You can condense the four lines above to one line using summary() on the specific attribute

```{r}
summary(all_trips_v2$ride_length)
```

#### Compare members and casual users


```{r}
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length~all_trips_v2$member_casual, FUN = mean)
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length~all_trips_v2$member_casual, FUN = median)
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length~all_trips_v2$member_casual, FUN = max)
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length~all_trips_v2$member_casual, FUN = min)
```

#### See the average ride time by each day for members vs casual users

```{r}
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length~all_trips_v2$member_casual + all_trips_v2$day_of_week, FUN = mean)
```
#### Notice that the days of the week are out of order. Let's fix that.

```{r}
all_trips_v2$day_of_week <- ordered(all_trips_v2$day_of_week, levels=c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"))


```


#### Now, let's run the average ride time by each day for members vs casual users


```{r}
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length~all_trips_v2$member_casual + all_trips_v2$day_of_week, FUN = mean)
```

#### analyze ridership data by type and weekday

```{r}
all_trips_v2 %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(started_at, label = TRUE)) %>%  #creates weekday field using wday()
  group_by(member_casual, weekday) %>%  #groups by usertype and weekday
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()							#calculates the number of rides and average duration 
  ,average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>% 		# calculates the average duration
  arrange(member_casual, weekday)	           # sorts
```

#### Let's visualize the number of rides by rider type


```{r}
all_trips_v2 %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(started_at, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  group_by(member_casual, weekday) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()
            ,average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>% 
  arrange(member_casual, weekday)  %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = number_of_rides, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")

```

#### Save the plot

```{r}
jpeg('plot1.jpg')
all_trips_v2 %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(started_at, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  group_by(member_casual, weekday) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()
            ,average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>% 
  arrange(member_casual, weekday)  %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = number_of_rides, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")
dev.off()
```



#### Let's create a visualization for average duration

```{r}
all_trips_v2 %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(started_at, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  group_by(member_casual, weekday) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()
            ,average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>% 
  arrange(member_casual, weekday)  %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = average_duration, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")

```

#### Save the plot


```{r}
jpeg('plot2.jpg')
all_trips_v2 %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(started_at, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  group_by(member_casual, weekday) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()
            ,average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>% 
  arrange(member_casual, weekday)  %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = average_duration, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")
dev.off()

```



### STEP 5: EXPORT SUMMARY FILE FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS

#### Create a csv file that we will visualize in Excel, Tableau, or my presentation software

```{r}
counts <- aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ all_trips_v2$member_casual + all_trips_v2$day_of_week, FUN = mean)
```



```{r}
write.csv(counts, file = 'avg_ride_length.csv')
```


```{r}
write.csv(all_trips_v2, file = 'all_trips_v2.csv') # Use row.names = FALSE

```
